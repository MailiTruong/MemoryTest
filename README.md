# MemoryTest
> Simple interface to organize the participants of my project's test

### Must-have:
- Button where I can enter the name of the participant and add it to the list of participants (2/10)
- List underneath of the participants (2/10)
- Button for each participant that displays his form with the questions and either empty boxes to be filled  or with the saved answers that can be modified (6/10)

### Nice-to-have:
- research bar by name (4/10)
- research bar by question (4/10)
- statistics module that adapts after each input (2/10)
